                                I am passionate about building automation solutions that replace tedious manual processes with efficient, scalable, and highly accurate software. With a strong foundation in Python, Django, Angular, and data processing techniques, I specialize in developing tools that optimize workflows, eliminate human error, and save businesses hundreds of hours of manual work. My expertise lies in automating complex processes, designing intuitive user interfaces, and ensuring seamless data integration, allowing companies to operate more efficiently and make data-driven decisions.
<br><br>
Below are two automation solutions I developedâ€”one for bulk PDF data extraction and another for automated worksite and time tracking. These projects showcase my ability to create intelligent, high-performance software that not only streamlines operations but also delivers real business impact by reducing costs, increasing accuracy, and improving overall productivity.

                            A construction company relied on a manual system to track <b>worker hours and site assignments</b>, leading to inefficiencies, frequent errors, and over <b>40 hours of wasted time</b> in payroll processing. To address this, I developed a <b>full-stack automation system</b> using <b>Angular</b> for the frontend and <b>Django & Django REST Framework</b> for the backend, streamlining time tracking and eliminating manual entry errors. The system features a <b>dynamic Angular UI</b> with editable tables for real-time work hour updates, seamlessly connected to a <b>Django REST API</b> that manages employees, worksites, and work hours. Using <b>OpenPyXL</b>, the application automates <b>Excel report generation</b>, creating payroll-ready files with custom filenames based on company, month, and year. To ensure data integrity, I optimized database handling, preventing issues like <b>missing workers, incorrect default values</b> (0 turning into 10), and <b>data loss</b>. This automation cut processing time down from <b>40 hours to just 3 hours</b>, improving accuracy, ensuring real-time updates, and significantly enhancing payroll and workforce management.

                            A topography firm needed to process thousands of Romanian cadastral documents daily, manually extracting structured dataâ€”a slow, error-prone process that hindered efficiency. To solve this, I developed a <b>Python-based automation tool</b> capable of processing <b>10,000+ PDFs simultaneously</b>, extracting critical information such as <b>Land Registry Number, Ownerâ€™s Name, Land Area, Construction ID, and Usage Category</b>. The tool leverages <b>pdfplumber</b> for text extraction and <b>regex</b> for precise data retrieval, ensuring high accuracy. The extracted data is then structured into an Excel file using <b>Pandas & OpenPyXL</b> for seamless formatting and reporting. Key features include <b>bulk PDF processing</b>, <b>intelligent data extraction</b>, and <b>automated error handling</b> to manage missing or inconsistent values. A <b>Tkinter-based interface</b> makes it user-friendly, allowing easy folder selection without requiring technical expertise. This automation <b>eliminates manual work</b>, drastically improving efficiency and ensuring professionals have <b>accurate, structured data</b> for faster decision-making in land registry and topography operations.
